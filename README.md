# TensorFlow React Interface

Just a sandpit for playing with a react interface to a tensor flow digit recognition model. 

The tensor-flow-default branch is the default implementation of the digit recognition training model from the TensorFlow samples. The problem with this example is that it uses 80% - 95% CPU in Chrome, and has a very janky inferface because of this (great for warming up the lap on a cold winters day!).

The main reason for this sandpit is to see how React, and maybe RxJs and webworks,  can improve the performance.
